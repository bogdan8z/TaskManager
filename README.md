# Task Manager

A simple full-stack task management application composed of a React frontend and a .NET backend.

## What the project does
- Lets users register and log in securely.
- Allows authenticated users to create and view their own tasks.
- Stores task data in SQL Server through a REST API.

## Frontend
- Built with React 18 and Vite.
- Provides the login/register experience and the task dashboard UI.
- Uses browser-based fetch requests to talk to the backend.
- Sends JWT tokens in the Authorization header for protected requests.

## Backend
- Built with ASP.NET Core (.NET 9).
- Exposes REST endpoints for authentication and task management.
- Uses Entity Framework Core with SQL Server for persistence.
- Implements JWT-based authentication and Swagger for API exploration.
